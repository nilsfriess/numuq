description = "My interests are in the design and analysis of efficient and robust parallel numerical methods for engineering and physical problems with heterogeneous material properties that vary over multiple scales. This is typical in energy and environmental applications, but also in material science and manufacturing. My research spans the whole range from the regularity analysis of solutions to the efficient parallel implementation of novel methods and their industrial application. I am particularly interested in multilevel and multiscale methods for partial differential equations with strongly varying and high contrast coefficients, in particular domain decomposition and multigrid methods, preconditioners for systems of PDEs, iterative eigensolvers, and multiscale discretisation techniques with applications in oil reservoir simulation, radioactive waste disposal, numerical weather and climate prediction, novel optical materials or composite materials."
