**Administrative Matters**  
Due to current situation around the COVID-19 pandemic the seminar will (at least initially) be held in an online form on the heiCONF platform. We will also create a moodle page for interaction and to share material. Possibly, we will be able to have the final presentations in a more traditional format, but that is very uncertain at this point.
